## Polotno API Key
I included my Polotno api key, notice it only supports local environment (localhost or 127.0.0.1) for non-commercial purpose.
It is easy to create your own free api key from [Polotno API](https://polotno.com/cabinet), then you can replace mine from webui Settings -> Canvas Editor
