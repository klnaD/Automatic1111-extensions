モデルキャッシュに関する仕様が変わりました。
モデルキャッシュを設定している場合、これまではweb-ui側のモデルキャッシュを使用していましたが、web-ui側の仕様変更により使えなくなりました。
そこで、web-ui側のモデルキャッシュを無効にしてSuperMerger側でモデルをキャッシュするように変更しました。よって、モデルキャッシュを使用する設定にしている場合、SuperMerger使用後にモデルのキャッシュが残ることになります。SuperMeger使用後はClear cacheボタンでメモリの解放を行って下さい。

The specifications regarding model caching have changed. If you have set up model caching, we used to utilize the model cache on the web-ui side. However, due to changes in the web-ui specifications, this is no longer possible. Therefore, I have disabled the model cache on the web-ui side and have made changes to cache the model on the SuperMerger side instead. As a result, if you have set it to use model caching, the model cache will remain after using SuperMerger. Please clear the cache using the "Clear cache" button to free up memory after using SuperMerger.
**Attention!**

A minimum of 64GB of CPU memory is required for the XL model merge. Even with 64GB of memory, depending on the software you are using in conjunction, there is a risk of system instability. Therefore, please work in a state where it is acceptable for the system to crash. I encountered a blue screen for the first time in a while.

**注意！**
XLモデルのマージには最低64GBのCPUメモリが必要です。64Gのメモリであっても併用しているソフトによってはシステムが不安定になる恐れがあるのでシステムが落ちてもいい状態で作業して下さい。私は久しぶりにブルースクリーンに遭遇しました。

## Knowon issues/既知の問題
If you have other extensions (like sd-webui-prompt-all-in-one) installed simultaneously, enabling the option to automatically open the browser upon launch can cause instability in its operation. It's likely an issue with Gradio, so it might be difficult to fix. Please disable that option and use it.  
他の拡張機能（sd-webui-prompt-all-in-oneなど）を同時にインストールしている場合、起動時にブラウザを自動的に開くオプションを有効にすると、動作が不安定になることがあります。Gradioの問題である可能性が高いので、修正は難しいかもしれません。そのオプションを無効にしてお使いください。

# Overview
This extension allows merged models to be loaded as models for image generation without saving them.
This extension can prevent the use of HDD and SSD.

## Usage

### Merge mode
#### Weight sum
Normal merge. Alpha is used. If MBW is enabled, MBW base is used as alpha.
#### Add difference
Add difference, if MBW is enabled, MBW base is used as alpha
#### Triple sum
Merge 3 models at the same time. alpha and beta are used. I added this function because there were three model selection windows, but I am not sure if it works effectively. 
#### sum Twice
Weight sum twice, alpha and beta are used. 

#### use MBW
If checked, block-by-block merging is enabled. Use the slider at the bottom of the screen to set the ratio of each block.

#### calcmode
If you select "cosine", the comparison is performed using cosine similarity, centered on the set ratio, and the ratio is calculated to eliminate loss due to merging. See below for more details.   
Thanks to [recoilme](https://github.com/recoilme) for devising the idea and to [SwiftIllusion](https://github.com/SwiftIllusion) for introducing this technique.

### save metadata
Enable "save metadata" to embed merge conditions as metadata, only in safetensor format. Embedded conditions can be viewed in the Metadata tab.

## Each button
### Merge
After merging, load as a model for generation. **Note that a different model is loaded than the model information in the upper left corner.** It will be reset when you re-select the model in the model selection screen on the top left.

### Gen.
Image generation is performed using the settings in the text2image tab.

### Merge and Gen
Merge and Generate image after merging.

### Set from ID
Read settings from merge log. The log is updated each time a merge is performed, and a sequential ID starting from 1 is assigned. Set on -1 will read the last merged configuration. The merge log is saved in extension/sd-webui-supermerger/mergehistory.csv. You can browse and search in the History tab. You can search and/or by separating with a half-width space.

### Sequential XY Merge and Generation
Performs sequential merge image generation. Effective in all merge modes.
#### alpha, beta
Change alpha and beta.
#### alpha and beta
Change alpha and beta at the same time. Separate alpha and beta with a single space, and separate each element with a comma. If only one number is entered, the same value is entered for both alpha and beta.  
Example: 0, 0.5 0.1, 0.3 0.4, 0.5
#### MBW
Performs a block-byblock merge. Enter ratios separated by newlines. Presets can be used, but be careful to **separate on a new line**.For Triple and Twice, enter two lines as a set. An odd number of lines will result in an error. 
#### seed
Changes the seed. Entering -1 will result in a fixed seed in the opposite axis direction.
#### model_A, B, C
Changes the model. The model selected in the model selection window is ignored.
#### pinpoint blocks
Changes only specific blocks in MBW. Choose alpha or beta for the opposite axis. If you enter a block ID, the alpha (beta) will change only for that block. As with the other types, use commas to separate them. Multiple blocks can be changed at the same time by separating them with a space or hyphen. NOT must be entered first to have any effect.
##### Input example
IN01, OUT10 OUT11, OUT03-OUT06, OUT07-OUT11, NOT M00 OUT03-OUT06

In this case:
- 1:Only IN01 changes
- 2:OUT10 and OUT11 change
- 3:OUT03 to OUT06 change
- 4:OUT07 to OUT11 change
- 5:All except for M00 and OUT03 to OUT06 are changed.  

Please be careful not to forget to input "0".

Block ID (only upper case letters are valid)
BASE,IN00,IN01,IN02,IN03,IN04,IN05,IN06,IN07,IN08,IN09,IN10,IN11,M00,OUT00,OUT01,OUT02,OUT03,OUT04,OUT05,OUT06,OUT07,OUT08,OUT09,OUT10,OUT11

for XL model
BASE,IN00,IN01,IN02,IN03,IN04,IN05,IN06,IN07,IN08,M00,OUT00,OUT01,OUT02,OUT03,OUT04,OUT05,OUT06,OUT07,OUT08

#### calcmode
change calclation mode.  
Note the correspondence between calculation mode and merge mode.

#### prompt
You can change the prompt. The negative prompt does not change. Separate with a new line.

### Reserve XY plot
The Reserve XY plot button reserves the execution of an XY plot for the setting at the time the button is pressed, instead of immediately executing the plot. The reserved XY plot will be executed after the normal XY plot is completed or by pressing the Start XY plot button on the Reservation tab. Reservations can be made at any time during the execution or non-execution of an XY plot. The reservation list is not automatically updated, so use the Reload button. If an error occurs, the plot is discarded and the next reservation is executed. Images will not be displayed until all reservations are finished, but those that have been marked "Finished" have finished generating the grid and can be viewed in the Image Browser or other applications.

It is also possible to move to an appointment at any location by using "|".  
Inputing "0.1,0.2,0.3,0.4,0.5|0.6,0.7,0.8,0.9,1.0"

0.1,0.2,0.3,0.4,0.5  
0.6,0.7,0.8,0.9,1.0  
The grid is divided into two reservations, "0.1,0.2,0.3,0.4,0.5" and "0.6,0.7,0.8,0.9,1.0" executed. This may be useful when there are too many elements and the grid becomes too large.

# Random Merge
Determines the merge ratio randomly.

## Usage
Select the `Random Mode` and press `Run Rand` to generate images with randomly set weights for the number of challenges specified by `Num of challenge`. The generation operates in XYZ mode, so the `STOP` button is effective. At that time, please set `Seed for Random Ratio` to `-1`. Using the same seed ensures reproducibility. If the number of generations exceeds 10, the grid will automatically become two-dimensional. Checking the `alpha` and `beta` in `Settings` will randomize them. For Elemental, `beta` will be disabled.

## Modes
### R, U, X
Random weights are set for all 26 blocks. The difference between `R`, `U`, and `X` is the range of random values. For X, specify `lower limit` to `upper limit` for each layer.
R: 0 ~ 1
U: -0.5 ~ 1.5
X: lower limit ~ upper limit

### ER, EU, EX
Random weights are set for all Elementals. The difference between `ER`, `EU`, and `EX` is the range of random values. For X, specify `lower limit` to `upper limit` for each layer.

### Custom
Specifies the hierarchical level to be randomized. Specify it as `custom`.
You can use `R`, `U`, `X`, `ER`, `EU`, and `EX`.
Example:
```
U,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,R,R,R,R,R,R,R,R,R,R,R,R,R
U,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,ER,0,0,0,0,0,0,X,0,0,0,0,0
```

### Settings
- `round` sets the decimal places for rounding. With the initial value of 3, it becomes 0.123.
- `save E-list` saves the key and ratio of Elemental in csv format to `script/data/`.

### XYZ Mode
You can use the XYZ mode by setting the `type` to `random`. Enter the number of times you want to randomize, and the parameters will be set accordingly.

For example:
```
X type: seed, -1, -1, -1
Y type: random, 5
```

With this configuration, a 3x5 grid will be created, and the model will generate images using weights randomly set for 5 iterations. Please make sure to set the randomization option on the random panel. It will not function properly if it is set to `off`.

### About Cache
By storing models in memory, continuous merging and other operations can be sped up.
Cache settings can be configured from web-ui's setting menu.

### unload button
Deletes the currently loaded model. This is used to free up GPU memory when using kohya-ss GUI. Once the model is deleted, you will not be able to generate images. If you want to generate images, please re-select models.

## LoRA
LoRA related functions. It is basically the same as kohya-ss scripts, but it supports block-by-block merging. Currently, it does not support V2.X series merging.

Note: LyCORIS supports only single merge due to its special structure. Only ratios of 1,0 can be used for single merges. If any other value is used, the result will not match the Block weight LoRA result, even if the value is "SAME TO STRENGTH".
LoCon will match reasonably well even with non-integers.

LoCon/LyCORIS merge to model is enable in web-ui 1.5 
|  1.X     | LoRA  | LoCon | LyCORIS |
|----------|-------|-------|---------|
| Merge to Model |   Yes   | Yes   | Yes     |
| Merge LoRAs   |    Yes   | Yes    | No     |
| Apply Block Weight(single)|Yes|Yes|Yes|
| Extract From Models   | Yes    | No    | No      |

|  XL     | LoRA  | LoCon | LyCORIS |
|----------|-------|-------|---------|
| Merge to Model |   Yes   | Yes   | Yes     |
| Merge LoRAs   |    Yes   | Yes    | No     |
| Extract From Models   | No    | No    | No      |

### merge to checkpoint
Merge LoRAs into a model. Multiple LoRAs can be merged at the same time.  
Enter LoRA name1:ratio1:block1,LoRA name2:ratio2:block2,... 
LoRA can also be used alone. The ":block" part can be omitted. The ratio can be any value, including negative values. There is no restriction that the total must sum to 1 (of course, if it greatly exceeds 1, it will break down).
To use ":block", use a block preset name from the bottom list of presets, or create your own. Ex: `LoRaname1:ratio1:ALL`

### Make LoRA
Generates a LoRA from the difference of two models.
If you specify a demension, it will be created with the specified dimension. If no demension is specified, LoRAs are created with dim 128.
The blend ratio can be adjusted by alpha and beta. (alpha x Model_A - beta x Model B) alpha, beta = 1 is the normal LoRA creation.

#### caution in using google colab
It has been reported that many errors occur when using with colab. This seems to be caused by multiple reasons.
First is a memory problem. It is recommended that the fp16 model be used. If the full model is used, at least 8 GB of memory is required. This is the amount used by this script. Also, it seems that the error occurs if different versions of diffusers are installed. version 0.10.2 has been tested.

### merge LoRAs
Merges one or more LoRAs. kohya-ss's latest script is used, so LoRAs with different dimensions can be merged, but note that the generated images may differ significantly because LoRAs are recalculated when dimensions are converted. 

The calculate dimention button calculates the dimensions of each LoRA and activates the display and sorting functions. The calculation is rather time-consuming and takes several tens of seconds for a LoRA of about 50. Newly merged LoRAs will not appear in the list, so please press the reload button. Dimension recalculation only calculates the added LoRAs.

### Metadata
#### create new
Create new minimal Metadata. Only dim, alpha, basemodel version, filename, and networktype will be generated.
#### merge
Information of each LoRA is saved, and tags are merged.
(The information of each LoRA is not visible with the simple Metadata reading function in the Web-UI)
#### save all
Information of each LoRA is saved.
(The information of each LoRA is not visible with the simple Metadata reading function in the Web-UI)
#### use first LoRA
Copy the information of the first LoRA as is.

Note: "LoRA" seems to be a specific term or abbreviation related to your context, which is not universally recognized and thus, is left as-is in the translation. If "LoRA" refers to something specific in English, feel free to replace it.

### Difference between Normal Merge and SAME TO STRENGTH
If the same to Strength option is not used, the result is the same as the merge in the script created by kohya-ss. In this case, the result is different from the case where LoRA is applied on Web-ui as shown in the figure below. The reason for this is related to the mathematical formula used to adopt LoRA into U-net. kohya-ss's script multiplies the ratio as it is, but the formula used to apply LoRA squares the ratio, so if the ratio is set to a number other than 1, or to a negative value, the result will differ from Strength (strength when applied).  Using the SAME TO STRENGTH option, the square root of the ratio is driven at merge time, so that Strength and the ratio are calculated to have the same meaning at apply time. It is also calculated so that a negative value will have the same effect. If you are not doing additional learning, for example, you may be fine using the SAME TO STRENGTH option, but if you are doing additional learning on the merged LoRA, you may not want to use anyone else's option.  
The following figures show the generated images for each case of normal image generation/same to Strength option/normal merge, using  merged LoRAs of figmization and ukiyoE. You can see that in the case of normal merge, even in the negative direction, the image is squared and positive.

## Analysis
Analyze the differences between two models. Select the models you wish to compare, model A and model B.
### Mode

The ASimilality mode compares tensors computed from qkv. Other modes calculates from the cosine similarity of each element. It seems that the calculated difference becomes smaller in modes other than ASimilality mode. Since the ASimilality mode gives a result that is closer to the difference in output images, you should generally use this one.
This Asimilality analysis was created by extending the [Asimilality script](https://huggingface.co/JosephusCheung/ASimilarityCalculatior).
### Block mode

This is a method to calculate the ratio for each hierarchy in modes other than the ASimilality mode. Mean represents the average, min represents the minimum value, and attn2 outputs the value of attn2 as the calculation result of the block.

This script uses some scripts from web-ui, mbw-merge and kohya-ss
